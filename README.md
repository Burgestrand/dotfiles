# Kims dotfiles

I built this as I set up a new computer. It has things I run into during daily operations, and nothing more.

It's not set up to work for any computer. There are some Kim-specific strings somewhere.

## Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Burgestrand/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd -
make
```
