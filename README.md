# Kims dotfiles

I built this as I set up a new computer. It has things I run into during daily operations, and nothing more.

It's set up using a Makefile. To install, run `make`, restart your terminal and you should be roughly done.

It's not set up to work for any computer. There are some Kim-specific strings somewhere.
